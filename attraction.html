                <h3>BOTI FALLS</h3>
                <p>Boto Falls is a twin waterfall located at Boti Yilo Krobo District in the Eastern Region of Ghana. These twin falls, which come from two rivers, are rederred to as female and male, according to local myth, a rainbow is formed when they merge. Boti is a seasonal fall which is a double side-by-side falls during the high flow and at the bottom of 250 concrete steps. During full flow you are surrounded in a canyon of falling water.It can be found in the forest of Huhunya. The larger one is mythical believed to be the man and the smaller one the female. The Falls is 30 meters high from the ground level.It finds its source from Ponmpon River which runs through the Huhunya forest reserve. It runs through the mountainous rock into a pool of water at the ground. According to oral history , the Boti Falls was found in the forest by a white Catholic Priest surveying the area. The first president of the Republic of Ghana, Dr. Kwame Nkrumah, visited it because in the 1960's, the waterfall was very famous. The best time to enjoy the Boti Falls is during the rainy season, June to August, the two waterfalls merge in the middle by splashing each other. The splash creates a wonderful colorful rainbow which is regarded by the local people as "a mating ceremony" </p>

                <h3>The Adome Bridge</h3>
                <p>The Adome Bridge(originally the Volta Bridge) is a latticed steel arch suspension bridge crossing the Volta River at Atimpoku in Ghana in West Africa. Its is the first permanent bridge to span the Volta River, which drains south into the Gulf of Guinea, and is Ghana's longest suspension bridge. It provides the main road passage , just south of the Akosombo Dam, between the Eastern Region and the Volta Region of Ghana. It was opened in 1957 by Kwame Nkrumah, Ghana's first president. The iconic crescent-shaped arch bridge is featured in Ghanaian stamps and currency. In 1953, the decision was made to build a bridge accross the Volta River to replace the overload ferry service at Senchi where delays were occassionlly up to a few days Reconnaissance indicated a good site for a singgle span crossing about 800 ft long at a narrow neck of the river at Adome about 2.5 miles upstream of the ferry and closer to the the-projected dam and power station in the Volta River Project. Several sketch designs for an arch bridge or a suspension bridge at Adome and other sites were drawn and cost estimates were developed. The standing Devellopment Committee chose the single-span arch at Adome. </p>

                <h3>Volta Lake</h3>
                <p>This is the largest artificial reservoir in the world based on surface area, is contained behind the Akosombo Dam which generates a substantial amount of Ghan's electricity. It is completely within the country of Ghana and has a surface area of 8,502 square kilometres (3,283 sq mi). It extends from Akosombo in the south to the northern part of the country. Lake Volta lies along the prime meridian, six degrees north of the Equator. The lake's northemmost point is close to the Yapei, and its southemmost extreme is at the Akosombo Dam,520 km (320m) downstream from Yapei. Akosombo Dam holds back both the White Volta River and the Black Volta River, where formed converged where the middle of the reservoir now lies. The Lake was formed by the Dam, which was originally conceived by the geologist Albert Ernest Kitson during the British colonial period in 1915, to exploit the river's energy for smelting localy sourced bauxite. The idea regained prominence at the end of the colonial are after World War II when Kwame Nkrumah became presidentof the Gold Coast colony and began striving for modernization of the land. British local formed a joint preparatory commission, which concluded that over 60,000 people will have to be relocated, but that the lake will boost opportunities for fishing, thus helping to feed the ppulation in the region.</p>

                <h3>Abetifi Stone Age Park</h3>
                <p>An ancestral home of the Kwahu people at Abetifi in the Eastern Region dating over 12,500 years old has been converted into an eco-tourism Park. The site, known as the "Abetifi Stone Park", sits on a 52-acre land. Prior to the development of the Park, part of the land used to be a refuse dump. The founder of the Park, Ben Addo, who is an indigene of Abetifi, said he was pushed to establish the Park after the Archaeology Department of the University of Ghana[UG] comfirmed the results an excavation at the site through carbon dating. Explaining how he got to know about the site and the rationale for establishing the Park, Mr Addo said having lived in Germany for about 25 years, he decided to come home for some holidays together with his family. It was during the holiday visit that he met the Head of the Archaeology Departmentof UG, one Dr Wattson, who at the time had come to the Bosompra at caves at Abefiti to conduct some archaeological excavations. He added that in 2013, Dr Wattson wrote to him, telling him that the carbon dating they coducted on the artifacts they found at the Bosompra Caves indicated that people lived at the site about 12,500 years ago, more than 10,500 years before Jesus Christ was born.

                <h3>Aburi Botanial Gardens</h3>
                <p>Aburi Botanical Gardens is a garden in the Eastern Region of Ghana. Today in the 1st centur, one cannot talk about horticulture in Ghana and West Africa without talking about the Aburi Botanical Gardens. The garden occupies an area of 64.8 hectares. It was opened in March 1890 and was founded by Gorvenor William Brandford-Griffith and Dr. John Farell Easmon, a Sierra Leonean medical doctor. Before the garden was established, it was the site of a sanatorium built in 1875 for Gold Coast govenment officials. During the gorvernorship of William Brandford-Griffith, a Basel missionary and Jamaican Moravian, Alexander Worthy Clerk, supervised the clearing of land around the sanatorium to start the Botanic Department. In 1890 Wlliam Crowther, a student from the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew, was appointed the garden's first curator. The gardens played an important role in encouraging cocoa production in south Ghana, by supplying cheap cocoa  seedlings and information about scientific farming methods. In May 2019, the chief of Aburi, Otowbour Gyan Kwasi II, called for the privatization of the Aburi Botanical Gardens. He thought that it was going to be an opportunity to invite investment to the tourist facility.One can find in the garden tree species such as silk cotton (ceiba pentandra), mahogany, cedar, siler oak and many more.</p>
