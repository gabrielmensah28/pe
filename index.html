                <p>The Ministry of Tourism, Arts, and Culture (MoTAC) is dedicated to <br> promoting Ghana as a premier destination rich in cultural heritage, vibrant arts, and diverse tourist attractions. <br> Initiatives such as the "Year of Return" in 2019 and the "Beyond the Return" campaign <br> have successfully attracted global attention, encouraging the African diaspora and international tourists <br> to explore Ghana's unique offerings. 
                    Building on this momentum, MoTAC aims to launch a new <br> campaign targeting both domestic and international audiences to showcase lesser-known attractions and cultural <br> experiences across the country.</p>
